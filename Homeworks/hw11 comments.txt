Ryleigh, Jackson, Harrison, Gabe:
-3 incorrect order, should be listed by name in ascending order

Ryleigh, Harrison:
-3 missing 3P's for the function that calculates the amount of pay the employee gets

Ryleigh, Jackson:
-9 missing design comments

Ryleigh, Gabe, Elliot:
(no credit) sentinel logic was not used, you should do:
.user_input = input("Enter Employee Information: ")
.while user_input != "":
.       # process data here
.       user_input = input("Enter Employee Information: ")

Ryleigh, Alexander, Harrison, Elliot:
(no credit) no function was called

Ryleigh:
-2 your list element should be of the format [employee name, paycheck], not [employee name, hours worked, hourly rate]

Ryleigh:
(no credit) should just be data.sort() with no arguments given, and should be sorted before the for loop that prints out paycheck reports

Ryleigh, Alexander, Jackson, Harrison, Gabe, Elliot:
-1 should use tab "\t" instead of spaces to line up the columns

Ryleigh, Alexander, Harrison, Elliot:
(no credit) missing a function declaration outside main function, for example:
.def get_paycheck(info):
.       return float(info[1]) * float(info[2])

Alexander, Aidan:
-1 missing description for the loop conditions

Alexander, Jiaming, Harrison, Olivia:
-2 only need to split input by commas
employee_info = raw_input.split(",")

Alexander:
you do not need the else branch in this case as nothing would be changed

Alexander:
-1 inefficient appending method
employee_list.append([employee_info[0], paycheck])

Jiaming:
-1 initialize an empty list with
employee_data =[]
also, you don't need to initialize _list as an empty list

Jiaming, Alexander, Aidan, Elliot:
-3 missing documentation comment about function call for calculating function

Aidan:
-2 you should check with an empty string "" instead of a space " ".  This is causing your program to raise an index error as it reads empty string, split it by whitespace which returns an empty list that could never be access by index. The if/else statements within the while loop are also unnecessary

Jackson:
-0.5 the header "Employees with Paychecks" should not be displayed if there were no entries

Jackson, Gabe:
(no credit) your list should be sorted by name in ascending order before outputting the paychecks using employee_list.sort()

Jackson:
-3 the variable you defined in main() will not be available in other functions. Here is how you should have done it:
.def pay_roll(employee_list):
.   return float(employee_list[1]) * float(employee_list[2])

Jackson, Gabe:
-1 Precond for pay_roll function is a list of strings that contains name, hours worked, and hourly rate 

Harrison, Olivia:
you should place the new input statement at the bottom (last line) of your while loop

Harrison:
-1 you only need to sort the list once after the while loop

Gabe:
-2 the parameter should be a list of strings that contains name, hours worked, and hourly rate, so an example of the function would be:
.def get_paycheck(info):
.       return float(info[1]) * float(info[2])

Olivia, Gabe:
-1 incomplete documentation comment about function call for calculating function

Elliot:
no test case answers were included. this part should have been calculated by hand to check your program's performance

Elliot:
-1 empty_list = [] should be sufficient to initialize. 
also, you should give it a more meaningful name such as employees_list, etc.
