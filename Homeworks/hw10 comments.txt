Ryleigh, Alexander:
-8 sentinel logic was not used, an example would be:
.content = input("Enter line: ")
.while content != '':
.    # process the string here
.    content = input("Enter line: ")

Ryleigh:
no split was used, instead of checking each space to count words, do: words = content.split() would return a list of words separated by whitespace

Ryleigh:
-4 you should just split the content into words, then use len(word) to count the number of characters contain in that word
also, you should not use 'continue'

Ryleigh, Alexander:
-4 design choices were not documented

Ryleigh:
the parentheses were redundant

Ryleigh, Alexander, Wanda:
-30 you must NOT use 'break'

Jiaming:
-4 you should use the input itself as a condition for the while loop, then only split it if it is not an empty string, for example:
.content = input("Enter line: ")
.while content != '':
.    # process the string here
.    content = input("Enter line: ")

Jiaming:
-4 you already have the total number of word count for each input, using len(), so it is inefficient to increase the counter inside the for loop
