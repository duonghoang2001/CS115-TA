Aidan, Cristian:
-2 the window was not closed after the click inside the box until the counter reached 11

Aidan, Jackson, Harrison, Elliot, Austin, Natalia:
-4 missing the answer to the questions in design

Aidan, Cristian:
-3 you were supposed to create 2 points, one by choice, and the other calculated based on the size, then use that 2 points to create the rectangle

Aidan, Cristian:
-3 the center of the box for the YES display should be calculated using the size

Aidan, Cristian:
-4 your while loop condition should be based on the result of inbetween function

Aidan, Cristian:
-2 'click to close' prompt was not display correctly due to the nested if statements

Harrison:
-6 missing main function's 3 P's

Harrison, Aidan, Cristian:
-3 instead of creating a new Text object to display click count everytime, you should use setText() method with the initial Text object

Harrison:
-4 missing box 'YES' label

Harrison:
-1 missing close prompt

Harrison:
-2 missing win.getPoint() to pause the program waiting for the user

Harrison:
-2 you should getMouse() once before the loop and use that point as the initial condition for the while loop

Harrison:
your window closed right after the program was run due to your while loop condition always satisfied and there was no getMouse() before close()

Harrison, Olivia, Austin:
-2 you were supposed to create 2 points, one by choice, and the other calculated based on the size

Olivia:
-2 you were getting new points without saving them to mouse_point to update your loop condition, which resulted in your loop keeping referring to the initial point clicked

Gabe:
-2 the close prompt should be 'click to close', your current prompt should be displayed at the beginning

Jiaming, Aidan, Austin, Cristian:
-2 you should have initialized your counter with 1, since the user already clicked once before the loop, then increased your counter after the getMouse() inside the loop because your program is not counting the last click (click that is inside the box) at the moment

Gabe:
-1 you should display the click time right after you increase your counter and before you get the next click

Cristian:
-1 your design should interlace with your code
