Aidan, Jackson, Harrison:
-4 missing the answer to the questions in design

Aidan:
-3 you were supposed to create 2 points, one by choice, and the other calculated based on the size, then use that 2 points to create the rectangle

Aidan:
-3 the center of the box for the YES display should be calculated using the size

Aidan:
-4 your while loop condition should be based on the result of inbetween function

Aidan:
-2 'click to close' prompt was not display correctly due to the nested if statements

Harrison:
-6 missing main function's 3 P's

Harrison:
-3 instead of creating a new Text object to display click count everytime, you should use setText() method with the initial Text object

Harrison:
-4 missing box 'YES' label

Harrison:
-1 missing close prompt

Harrison:
-2 missing win.getPoint() to pause the program waiting for the user

Harrison:
-2 you should getMouse() once before the loop and use that point as the initial condition for the while loop

Harrison:
your window closed right after the program was run due to your while loop condition always satisfied and there was no getMouse() before close()

Harrison, Olivia:
-2 you were supposed to create 2 points, one by choice, and the other calculated based on the size

Olivia:
-2 you were getting new points without saving them to mouse_point to update your loop condition, which resulted in your loop keeping referring to the initial point clicked

Gabe:
-2 the close prompt should be 'click to close', your current prompt should be displayed at the beginning
