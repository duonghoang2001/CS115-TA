Note: 
- Potential Plagiarism: Shandin and Ryleigh (both in the same lab team)
- Late Submission (50% credit): Austin
- Program not included in main(): Wanda 
>>> No point taken off yet since not mentioned in rubric
>>> Comment: Your program should all be included in your def main() (by indentation) instead of just the first line (total = 0), then call main() (aligned with def main())

Ryleigh, Shandin:
-4 No nested if was used. The prompt for a cheeseburger should only be prompted when the user said 'y' for a hamburger.
1.    # ask fourth choice (hamburger)
2.    hamburger = input("Would you like a Hamburger? ")
3.    # if the user desired the item,
4.    if hamburger == 'y': 
5.        # ask additional choice (cheeseburger)
6.        cheeseburger = input("Would you like cheese on that? ")
7.        # if the user desired the additional item,
8.        if cheeseburger == 'y':
(and so on)

Ryleigh, Jiaming, Aiden, Olivia:
-10 Design was included but not completed. There should be design comments for all the other prompts, the bill calculations, output of bill with tip, and closing ment

Alex:
-4 unnecessary else statements. Your code should work exactly the same without your current else statements, so you don't need to include them for better efficiency

Alex:
-5 incomplete design comments for the rest of the user prompts

Aiden, Olivia, Shandin:
for part D, remember to also format it as 2 decimals (0.00)

Jiaming, Jackson, Harrison:
a few spelling errors in the prompts

Jackson, Shandin, Wanda:
-5 incomplete design. There should be design comments for each of the prompts

Harrison:
-1 use .format() instead of round() as round() will not show 2 decimals in cases where the 2nd decimal is 0. Here is a way to display correctly:
# output total bill before tip
print("The total for your food is ${:.2f}".format(total_bill))

Harrison, Austin:
-10 no design was included nor completed

Jackson, Gabe:
-1 change restaurant's name

Gabe:
-1 instead of printing the prompt then calling input() separately, combine them like this:
cheese_sandwich = input("Would you like a grilled cheese sandwich? ")

Ryleigh, Alex, Aiden, Jackson, Harrison, Gabe:
use += for the accumulator next time. So,
instead of: bill = bill + 5.99
do: bill += 5.99

Elliot, Austin:
-2 redundant str(input()). input() already gets inputs as strings, so you don't need to typecast them. This should be efficient:
grilled_cheese = input("Would you like a grilled cheese sandwich? ")

Austin:
-2 missing test cases B and E in the comments at the bottom

Natalia:
-4 incomplete design for the rest of the prompt. You should be more specific in your design comment
-5 incomplete design for the second part:
# calculate amount of tip and add to total
# output total with tip, with 2 decimal places 

Cristian:
-1 you don't need the else statement for your last if. When there is nothing change in the else case, then the else statement is redundant.

Cristian, Jackson:
-2 incomplete design. Missing comment for:
# output total with tip, with 2 decimal places 

Shandin:
-2 incomplete design. Missing comment for:
# calculate amount of tip and add to total

Wanda:
-4 unnecessary elif statements:
- You should use else instead of elif for the nested if statement since there are only 2 cases: input == 'y' and input != 'y'. You would use elif statements when there are more than 2 cases.
- This assignment is designed in a way where you don't need else (nor elif) statements for the independent if statements if you use the accumulator to keep track of the bill. For example:
1. # ask first choice (grilled cheese sandwich)
2.    cheese_sandwich = input("Would you like a grilled cheese sandwich? ")
3.    # if the user desired the item,
4.    if cheese_sandwich == 'y': 
5.        # add price to total bill
6.         total_bill += 4.49
(and so on)
