Alexander, Aidan:
-2 you need to clear the screen (undraw some objects) before displaying the roll/pass result, then clear one more time before prompting for next action

Alexander:
-1 you need to update the Text object using setText() instead of keep drawing on top of each other

Alexander, Jackson, Olivia, Gabe, Elliot:
-2 you should draw the image inside this function, not in the play_turn function

Alexander:
-2 while loop failed to run as function play_turn return player_count and player_pass as str instead of int

Alexander, Ryleigh:
-1 program failed to display text as Text object was given too many argument, you should only pass one string instead of having multiple elements separated by commas like in print()

Jiaming:
-1 text objects were not properly displayed due to off ratio between text size and window size

Jiaming, Jake:
-0.5 input boxes covered part of the prompt

Jiaming, Aidan, Austin, Cristian:
-2 function return Image object, not the window, then the object would be undraw in the play_turn function

Jiaming, Harrison, Olivia, Elliot, Wanda:
-1 missing prolog for draw_die function

Harrison, Elliot, Wanda:
-1 missing prolog for inbetween function

Ryleigh:
-2 your inbetween function failed to perform the task, you can see the correct version in homework 9

Ryleigh, Aidan:
(no credit) title was not displayed

Ryleigh:
-1 incorrect parameter for draw_die function, should be:
def draw_die(roll, win):

Ryleigh:
-2 objects were created but weren't drawn 

Ryleigh:
-1 missing getMouse() to leave time for user to type

Ryleigh:
-2 missing getText() to get input from boxes

Ryleigh:
-2 missing importing graphics library 

Ryleigh, Olivia:
-5 objects were created but not used

Ryleigh, Aidan, Austin, Cristian:
-1 missing a parameter "player" and incorrect parameter provided
def pass_or_roll(player, win):

Ryleigh, Olivia:
-1 you don't get Entry nor input() for the action, you get user click in corresponding button

Ryleigh:
-1 a Rectangle object does not have setText() operation, you have to create a Text object centered at the center of the Rectangle object

Ryleigh:
-1 buttons were not drawn

Ryleigh:
-1 missing call to inbetween function to verify which action was chosen

Ryleigh:
-10 penalty for codes outside of main function. Also, you do not need to give an argument when calling main()

Aidan, Austin:
-1 missing display round count

Aidan:
-2 player 2 was never prompt to choose an action due to incorrect if statement indentation in main funcion

Aidan:
-1 skip count was not updated correctly

Aidan:
-1 program failed to perform pass action 

Aidan:
-1 some uninitialized objects were set causing program to crash

Aidan:
-1 some uninitialized objects were undrawn causing program to crash

Aidan, Olivia, Cristian, Wanda:
-1 function failed to handle point clicked outside of the 2 buttons

Harrison, Wanda:
-10 penalty for using break, you can just use the return of inbetween function as your while loop condition

Olivia:
-1 instead of hard code the file name as the Image object argument, you can just pass in "{}.gif".format(number_rolled)

Olivia:
-1 incorrect call to draw() operator. It should be of the form: OBJECT.draw(win) with OBJECT is a graphics object that was initialized

Olivia:
-1 incorrectly create a Text object, should just be Text(...), not win.Text(...)

Olivia:
(no credit) incorrect call to undraw() operator. It should be of the form: OBJECT.undraw() with OBJECT is a graphics object that was drawn

Elliot:
-0.5 player2's pass count display was not updated

Austin:
-1 buttons should be created here instead of in main()

Austin, Cristian:
-1 player action prompt should be created here instead of in main()

Jake, Cristian:
-3 missing display player name, current total rolls, current passes left for each player

Wanda:

Wanda:
-1 missing prolog for play_turn function

Wanda:

Wanda:
-1 no prompts were displayed and game info was not updated each round
