Ryleigh, Alexander, Harrison:
-5 This design does not use the intended functions (play_turn, pass_or_roll) in the design. These functions will have their own 3 P's and simplify the behavior of main. Each is described in the assignment instructions.

Ryleigh, Alexander, Jackson, Harrison, Olivia, Gabe:
-2 Missing 3 P's for the two functions play_turn and pass_or_roll

Ryleigh:
-1 Missing initialization of round counter and its increment

Alexander:
-2 Your design should be inside a function  (so when you write your codes, they are also included inside that function)

Alexander, Jackson, Harrison:
-5 Incomplete design. You should provide more details ( description, totals, counts, turns, display )

Jiaming:
-1 Missing purpose of functions play_turn and pass_or_roll

Jiaming:
-1 Missing add roll to total and display roll to the player in the play_turn function whenever they roll the dice

Jiaming:
Also, the sum+=0 is redundant.

Jiaming:
-0.5 set round counter to 1, not 0

Jiaming:
-1 Missing initialization of roll totals and pass counts for each player

Jiaming:
-1 Missing while loop

Aidan:
-0.5 pass_or_roll function has 1 parameter which is the player's name

Gabe:
-1 Missing while loop description (when will the condition be met)

Aidan:
-1 pass_or_roll function will not print whether it is a P or R, it returns the value in that case. Your function should use sentinel logic for the input validation.

Aidan:
-1 you should use while loop instead of for loop in the main function for the rounds as you do not know how many rounds will there be

Aidan:
-1 initialization should be done before the loop, not within it for the roll totals, pass count, and round count

Aidan:
-5 your design should be included for each function, not having them all in one chunk

Jackson:
-1 Missing return in play_turn

Jackson:
-2 You must not define one function within another

Gabe:
-3 Your play_turn function design is containing the design of the main function. You should have a design for the main function also
