Ryleigh, Alexander:
-5 This design does not use the intended functions (play_turn, pass_or_roll) in the design. These functions will have their own 3 P's and simplify the behavior of main. Each is described in the assignment instructions.

Ryleigh, Alexander:
-2 Missing 3 P's for the two functions play_turn and pass_or_roll

Ryleigh:
-1 Missing initialization of round counter and its increment

Alexander:
-2 Your design should be inside a function  (so when you write your codes, they are also included inside that function)

Alexander:
-5 Incomplete design. You should provide more details ( description, totals, counts, turns, display )

Jiaming:
-1 Missing purpose of functions play_turn and pass_or_roll

Jiaming:
-1 Missing add roll to total and display roll to the player in the play_turn function whenever they roll the dice

Jiaming:
Also, the sum+=0 is redundant.

Jiaming:
-0.5 set round counter to 1, not 0

Jiaming:
-1 Missing initialization of roll totals and pass counts for each player

Jiaming:
-2 Missing while loop
