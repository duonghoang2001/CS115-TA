Team 1:
-0.5 for pre-cond, user ID is str type, not int type

Team 1:
-1 should use tab \t to line up the columns

Team 2:
-0.5 missing types of pre-cond: patient number (str), 3 tempeartures (floats)

Team 2:
-3 missing design comments for the diagnosis if/elif/else statements

Team 2:
-6 missing made-up test case

Team 2:
-6 program failed to pass all test cases except for the no patient test case

Team 2:
-1 your PT_list is a dictionary, not a list
also, you only need to initialize the PT_list = [], fever = 0, chilled = 0, all the other initializations were redundant

Team 2:
-2 the temperatures should be cast as floats instead of ints

Team 2:
-6 incorrect implementation of list
+ the name is the first element in your <element> list, thus, should be element[0] instead of element[i]
+ PT_list[i] = (element[i], average) is not a valid syntax even when you initialized it as a dict
+ Here is a way to add a new element to a 2-D list:
PT_list = []
PT_list.append([element[0], average])

Team 2:
-2 instead of using a counter for the number of patients, using len(PT_list) should give you that number

Team 2:
-1 you only need to check once if there were more than 0 patients processed (len(PT_list) > 0) then do the percentage calculations and print them out in the same if statement
