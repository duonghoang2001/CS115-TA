-2 missing library documentations for math and time library

-1 missing 'seed' in the comment. Here is an example of the answer:
no, do not get the same answer because random numbers are different each run because they are using a different seed every time

-2 missing justification about the time used and accuracy of the 2 methods

-5 fail to protect from division by zero when calculating the pi approximation

-2 missing import math for pi, you should not declare a variable pi in your program

-1 missing calling process_time() before the for loop. Here is what you should have done:
start = process_time()
<for loop>
end = process_time()
time_taken = end - start

-1 no need to typecast str() in your input

-1 missing documentation for variables x and y

-1 incorrect output for the time taken greater than 1 min. I suggest doing the calculation separately before the print function

-1 missing information about which CPU, CPU clock speed
